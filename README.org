*** usage

**** keep a user configuration file

1. Let's say this repository is saved as =dotfiles= and you are in it.
2. Create a directory with a name of your choice, prepending =_=.
3. ~cd~ inside the new directory.
4. Pretending that you are at =$HOME=, recreate the location of the configuration file.
  - For example, say you want to back up [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_MIME_Applications#mimeapps.list][mimeapps.list]]. Create the path of folders =...dotfiles/_mime/.config=, and write the file =...dotfiles/_mime/.config/mimeapps.list=.

*Note*: Sometimes, a subpath may not exist, and that will affect both keeping and loading. Say you want to keep =$HOME/.config/foo/bar.txt=, but =$HOME/.config= doesn't exist yet. If you call ~./stow.tcl~ now to load everything, a link called =$HOME/.config= will be created referencing somewhere in =dotfiles=. When other files get put into =$HOME/.config=, all those files (even those you don't want to keep) will actually reside in this repository!

For this reason, edit the =fend= list inside =stow.tcl=. For the above example, add =.config= to the list (to link =foo/=) or add =.config/foo= (to link =bar.txt=).

**** load/restore all user configuration files

*Note*: If you don't want to load some =_configuration=, place it in =disabled= first.

1. Go to the =dotfiles= root directory.
2. ~./stow.tcl~

**** load entire system configuration

*IMPORTANT*: Customised to my system. Will most likely bork your system.

/WIP/

1. Go to the =dotfiles= root directory.
2. ~./load.tcl~
  - presumes: drives prepped; base system and tcl installed; internet available

**** remove a user configuration file.

/WIP/

1. Find the link and manually ~rm~ it.
